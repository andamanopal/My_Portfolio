# Andaman's
Hi, my name is Andaman Lekawat and I'm currently a 4th-year student in Mechanical Engineering Department, KAIST, South Korea. My main personal interest lies in the field of robotics, machine learnings, and data science. Below are some of my personal projects where I applied various methods and toolboxes to topics of my interests in order to demonstrate and improve my data science skills so that I can become an aspiring data scientist in the near future!! I hope you enjoy my work :D

## Project 1 : League of Legends EDA and Win Prediction
- Utilize riot API to collect matches statistics (Challenger division, NA region)
- Preprocess and prepare raw data into more managable .csv format
- Built a classification model to predict whether a team will win or lose by observing the team statistics at 10-minutes mark 

### Mini-Project 1 : Smart AC RL Agent by Custom OpenAI Gym Environment 
(Part of SuperAI Season 2 qualification process, first round)
- Implement OpenAI gym to create a custom environment for a simple single-agent RL training
- Use PPO algorithm imported from SB3
